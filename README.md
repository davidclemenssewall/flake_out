This package contains a geometric filter for classifying airborne particles (originally designed for snowflakes) in Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) point clouds. Some example data, a demonstration script, and a tool for manually classifying TLS points are also provided. Full details of the filter can be found in Clemens-Sewall et al 2021. If you use this filter in an academic publication, please cite (manuscript submitted to Cold Regions Sci. Tech., will update once published):



This video shows the manual classification tool in action. The point that the user is classifying is always the green point in the center of the field of view that the viewport rotates around. The user can indicate that the point is an airborne particle by pressing 'f' or is ground by pressing 'g'.
